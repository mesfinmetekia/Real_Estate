        <h1>Benefits of Residential Real Estate and Home Ownership?</h1>
        <p>
            Homeownership, also known as owner-occupancy, is the most common type of real estate investment in the United States. 
            According to the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), roughly two-thirds of residents own their homes. Often, 
            these owners have financed the purchase by taking out a mortgage loan, in which the property acts as collateral for the debt.
