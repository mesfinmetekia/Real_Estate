        <h1>Benefits of Residential Real Estate and Home Ownership?</h1>
        <p>
            Homeownership, also known as owner-occupancy, is the most common type of real estate investment in the United States. 
            According to the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), roughly two-thirds of residents own their homes. Often, 
            these owners have financed the purchase by taking out a mortgage loan, in which the property acts as collateral for the debt.

            Owning a home is the fulfillment of the Ethiopian dream. For others, it is their worst nightmare. Purchasing a home is one of 
            the biggest financial decisions you will make in your life. So, before you decide to buy, carefully consider the ups and downs of 
            homeownership.
            Before buying a home, it is important to consider how such a purchase will affect your finances and your lifestyle. It makes sense to 
            review all of the advantages and disadvantages of becoming a homeowner before making this big commitment.

        <p>
          - Homeownership is not for everyone<br>
          - Homeownership requires you to have a stable or growing income.<br>
          - The financial benefits of homeownership are long-term. You should have a budget and a savings plan in place before buying a home. Owning a 
            home is a big responsibility.<br>
          - Your credit score will impact how much you can borrow and at what terms. If you have substantial credit card debt, you may want to seek the help of a 
            credit counseling agency and debt management program and pay your debt down, before applying for a mortgage.<br>
