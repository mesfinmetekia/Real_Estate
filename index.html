                    <p>Real estate is property made up of land and the buildings on it as well as the natural resources 
                        of the land including uncultivated flora and fauna, farmed crops and livestock, water, and any 
                        additional mineral deposits.</P>
                        <h2>What is Real Estate<h2>
                            <p>Real estate is a tangible asset and a type of real property. Real property examples include land, 
                            buildings, and other improvements, plus the rights of use and enjoyment of that land and each of 
                            its improvements. Renters and leaseholders may have the right to inhabit land or buildings that 
                            are considered a part of their estate, but these rights themselves are not, strictly speaking, considered real estate..
                            Real property is not the same thing and should not be confused with personal property. Personal property includes intangible 
                            assets like investments along with tangible assets such as furniture and fixtures like a dishwasher. Also, even renters may 
                            claim parts of a home as personal property, provided you bought and installed the property with the lessor’s permission.
                            When it comes to investing, residential real estate is less expensive and more feasible to individuals, while commercial 
                            real estate is more valuable and more stable.
                            You can invest in real estate directly—buying land or property—or indirectly through buying shares in publicly traded real estate 
                                investment trusts (REITs) or mortgage-backed securities (MBS). </p>
                          <h2>Types of Real Estate<h2> 
                              Although the media often refers to the “real estate market,” real property examples can be grouped into three broad categories based on 
                              their use. <br>
                             *  Residential real estate: includes undeveloped land, houses, condominiums, and townhouses. The structures may be single-family or multi-family 
                              dwellings and may be owner-occupied or rental properties.<br>
                              * Commercial real estate: includes nonresidential structures such as office buildings, warehouses, and retail buildings. These buildings may be 
                              free-standing or in shopping malls.<br>
                              * Industrial real estate: includes factories, business parks, mines, and farms. These properties are usually larger and their locations may provide 
                              access to transportation hubs such as rail lines and harbors.
